<h1 align="center">Hey there! I'm Monika üë©‚Äçüíª‚ú®</h1>

<p align="center">A software developer by role, a curious learner by soul, and a creator at heart. I believe tech is not just about solving problems‚Äîit's about crafting experiences, telling stories through code, and constantly evolving. I love exploring every corner of the tech world and getting hands-on with new tools and ideas, turning curiosity into creativity and learning into building. Let‚Äôs build, break, and learn‚Äîone line of code at a time üöÄ</p>
